To get started with the lab you need to install SageMath on your computer.

You can go to:
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html

and pick your flavor.  
The most common varieties are macOS, Windows, and Linux.... These three pre-built binaries are available from the above page.
If you have any problems one of the course cadre can help you.

In order to run the lab, open "SageMath 9.x Notebook"
This runs a localhost webserver on your machine and will start a jupyter-notebook interface.
Navigate to the file "CYBER-202 -- Lab X -- xxxx.ipynb" and open.
